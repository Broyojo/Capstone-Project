# Capstone Project

## Description
This is the repository for our Capstone Project. It contains all of our circuit boards for Bluebox, our computer built in [The Ultimate Nerd Game](https://jimmycushnie.itch.io/tung) (TUNG). These boards were developed in the [TUNG Tuesday livestream series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTpeCYU3Fi8VfnOLpLElXjRq2-74i5hF)  and [TUNG Computer series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTpeCYU3Fi9B5lPT3Z221ydczUSOlp5g). 

## How To Use This Project
Clone the repository into your `Saved Boards` folder for TUNG by doing
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Broyojo/Capstone-Project [saved boards folder]
```
Then, in TUNG, you will be able to load any of the boards from this repository. Make sure you use TUNG 0.2.7.

For reference, the Bluebox board is called "Computer Prototype 18".
